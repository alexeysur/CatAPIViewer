# CatAPIViewer_v2
**It's mini-project as test task for Intership program Summer-2020 in MacPow company (Kyiv, Ukraine).**

It's second release, because the first was very terrible.<br>

Input data:<br>
Here is a database of cats — [docs.thecatapi.com](https://docs.thecatapi.com) where you can get any data on the breeds, photos of specific information about cats and much more.<br>
<p>
What I have done: <br>  
* iOS app using Swift, with a list of cat breeds and a separate screen for a detailed description of the breed.<br>
* Also I made the quiz, something like “Guess the breed by the photo”<br>
* And I made gallery with a list of photos and a separate screen to see them full-size.<br>
</p>
Limitations: <br>
1. The application have only four different screens. <br>
2. The application don't use third-party dependencies. <br>
