# CatAPIViewer_v2
**It's mini-project as test task for Intership program Summer-2020 in MacPow company (Kyiv, Ukraine).**

Input data:<br>
Here is a database of cats — [docs.thecatapi.com](https://docs.thecatapi.com) for you to get any data on the breeds, photos of specific cats and much more.

What I have done:  
iOS app using Swift, with a list of cat breeds and a separate screen for a detailed description of the breed;
Also I made the quiz, something like “Guess the breed by the photo”;
And I made gallery with a list of photos and a separate screen to see them full-size.

Limitations:
1. The application must have at least two different screens.
2. The application should not use third-party dependencies.

## Getting Started
Clone or download the repo onto your machine and open it in Xcode.
To start collecting data about cats, you need to get an API key for requests.
